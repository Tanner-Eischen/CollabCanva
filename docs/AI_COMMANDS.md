### üó∫Ô∏è Tilemap Commands

#### Paint Tiles
Paint rectangular regions with tiles.

**Examples:**
- "Paint grass tiles from (0,0) to (10,10)"
- "Fill rows 5-15, columns 5-15 with water tiles"
- "Paint a stone path from (10,10) to (20,10)"

**Tile Types:**
- grass, dirt, water, stone, flower

#### Erase Tiles
Remove tiles from regions.

**Examples:**
- "Erase tiles from (5,5) to (10,10)"
- "Clear the tiles in rows 0-20, columns 0-20"

#### Generate Tilemaps
Create procedural tilemaps using algorithms.

**Examples:**
- "Generate a 50x50 noise terrain tilemap"
- "Create a 40x40 cave tilemap"
- "Generate a 30x30 path tilemap with 2-tile wide paths"
- "Make a 60x60 island tilemap"

**Algorithms:**
- **noise**: Natural terrain using Simplex Noise (good for outdoor landscapes)
- **caves**: Organic cave structures using Cellular Automata
- **paths**: Winding paths using Random Walk algorithm
- **island**: Island surrounded by water

**Parameters:**
- `width`, `height`: Tilemap dimensions (1-500)
- `scale`: Noise scale for terrain (default: 0.1)
- `fillProbability`: Wall density for caves (default: 0.45)
- `pathWidth`: Width of paths (default: 1)

### üîç Query Commands

#### Get Canvas State
Retrieve information about the canvas.

**Examples:**
- "What shapes are on the canvas?"
- "Show me the canvas state"
- "How many shapes are there?"
- "What's the tilemap size?"

#### Get Selected Shapes
Get details about selected shapes.

**Examples:**
- "What shapes are selected?"
- "Tell me about the selected shapes"
- "Show selected shape properties"

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
‚úÖ "Create a red circle at (200, 200) with radius 50"  
‚ùå "Make a shape"

### 2. Use Coordinates
‚úÖ "Move shapes to (300, 400)"  
‚ùå "Move shapes over there"

### 3. Specify Selection
‚úÖ "Delete selected shapes"  
‚úÖ "Change color of all circles to blue"  
‚ùå "Delete them" (ambiguous)

### 4. Batch Operations
For efficiency, combine operations:
- "Create 5 circles in a row from (100, 100) to (500, 100)" ‚úÖ
- Instead of creating one circle at a time ‚ùå

### 5. Use Natural Language
The AI understands conversational commands:
- "Can you move the selected shapes to the right by 100 pixels?"
- "Please create a red rectangle at position 200, 300"

### 6. Tilemap Generation
For procedural tilemaps, experiment with parameters:
- **Small scale** (0.05): More variation, islands/regions
- **Large scale** (0.2): Smoother, larger features
- **Cave fill** (0.3-0.5): Adjust wall/floor ratio

## Limitations

### Safety Constraints
- **Max shapes per command**: 100
- **Max tiles per command**: 10,000
- **Canvas bounds**: 0-5000 pixels
- **Tilemap max size**: 500x500 tiles
- **Rate limit**: 10 requests per minute

### Confirmation Required
Operations that delete more than 10 shapes require confirmation:
```
"Delete 50 shapes" ‚Üí "Are you sure? Add confirm=true"
```

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait 60 seconds before sending another command
- Combine multiple operations into one command

**"Canvas bounds exceeded"**
- Coordinates must be between 0-5000
- AI will clamp to safe bounds automatically

**"Too many shapes"**
- Canvas limit: 1000 shapes total
- Consider deleting unused shapes

**"Invalid tile type"**
- Use only: grass, dirt, water, stone, flower
- Check spelling and case

## Examples by Use Case

### Game Level Design
```
1. "Generate a 50x50 noise terrain tilemap"
2. "Paint a stone path from (10,10) to (40,40)"
3. "Add water tiles around rows 0-5, columns 0-50"
```

### UI Mockup
```
1. "Create 3 rectangles in a row at (100,100) with 20px spacing"
2. "Align all rectangles to the top"
3. "Make the rectangles blue, green, and red"
```

### Data Visualization
```
1. "Create 10 circles in a grid"
2. "Arrange them in a 5x2 grid starting at (200,200)"
3. "Resize all circles to match data values"
```

## Need Help?

If the AI doesn't understand your command:
1. Try rephrasing in simpler terms
2. Break complex operations into steps
3. Use the example commands as templates
4. Check the console for detailed error messages
