## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific with Details
‚úÖ "Create a red circle at (200, 200) with radius 50"  
‚ùå "Make a shape"

‚úÖ "Generate a 50x50 Perlin noise terrain with scale 0.08"  
‚ùå "Make a map"

### 2. Use Coordinates (When Known)
‚úÖ "Move shapes to (300, 400)"  
‚ùå "Move shapes over there"

**But AI understands relative commands too:**
- "Move selected shapes to the center of the canvas" ‚úÖ
- "Place a circle near the selected rectangle" ‚úÖ

### 3. Specify Selection Clearly
‚úÖ "Delete selected shapes"  
‚úÖ "Change color of all circles to blue"  
‚ùå "Delete them" (ambiguous)

### 4. Use Multi-Turn Planning
The AI can plan complex operations:

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "I want to create a platformer level"
AI: "I'll create a platformer level. Let me plan:
     1. Generate terrain using Perlin noise
     2. Add platform layers
     3. Place enemies
     4. Add collectibles
     Should I proceed?"
User: "Yes, but make it medium difficulty"
AI: "Generating medium difficulty platformer..."
```

### 5. Let AI Ask Clarifying Questions
Don't over-specify. The AI will ask if needed:
```
User: "Create a terrain"
AI: "What theme? Forest, desert, or ice?"
User: "Forest"
AI: "Generating forest terrain..."
```

### 6. Use Smart Suggestions (‚ö†Ô∏è Foundation Fix Required)
Click the **Quick Action chips** above the chat input:
- üí° Contextually generated based on canvas state
- üåç "Generate terrain" (when canvas empty)
- üé® "Add decorations" (when tilemap exists)
- ‚ö° "Optimize performance" (when many objects)

### 7. Experiment with Procedural Parameters

**Perlin Noise (Terrain):**
- **Scale 0.03-0.05**: Large continents, ocean
- **Scale 0.08-0.12**: Rolling hills, varied terrain
- **Scale 0.15-0.25**: Bumpy, highly varied
- **Octaves 4-6**: Good detail balance
- **Octaves 1-2**: Simple, smooth

**Cellular Automata (Caves):**
- **Initial Density 0.40**: Open caves, large rooms
- **Initial Density 0.50**: Dense, narrow passages
- **Iterations 3-5**: Smooth, organic
- **Iterations 10+**: Very smooth, rounded

**Random Walk (Paths):**
- **Turn Probability 0.05**: Mostly straight
- **Turn Probability 0.20**: Winding, natural
- **Branch Probability 0.0**: Single path
- **Branch Probability 0.1**: River delta

### 8. Request Modifications
AI remembers context:
```
User: "Generate a 50x50 terrain"
AI: *generates terrain*
User: "Make it more varied"
AI: *regenerates with higher octaves*
User: "Add a river through the middle"
AI: *adds river using Random Walk*
```

### 9. Let AI Find Assets ‚ú® NEW

Don't specify exact tileset IDs‚Äîlet the AI discover the best match:

**Good:**
```
User: "Paint a forest background"
AI: [Searches library] ‚Üí Finds "Fantasy Forest Pack"
    [Auto-selects appropriate tiles]
    ‚úì Done!
```

**Also Good:**
```
User: "I need water tiles with auto-tiling"
AI: [Filters for: water + autotile]
    ‚Üí Found 2 matches, using "Water Set Complete"
```

**Not Necessary:**
```
User: "Use tileset ID abc123 to paint grass" ‚ùå
Better: "Paint some grass" ‚úì
```

The AI will:
- Match by theme and materials
- Consider tile size compatibility
- Prefer auto-tile enabled sets
- Use named tiles for precision

---

## Limitations

### Safety Constraints
- **Max shapes per command**: 100
- **Max tiles per command**: 10,000
- **Canvas bounds**: 0-5000 pixels
- **Tilemap max size**: 500x500 tiles
- **Rate limit**: 10 requests per minute

### Confirmation Required
Operations that delete more than 10 shapes require confirmation:
```
"Delete 50 shapes" ‚Üí "Are you sure? Add confirm=true"
```

---

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait 60 seconds before sending another command
- Combine multiple operations into one command

**"Canvas bounds exceeded"**
- Coordinates must be between 0-5000
- AI will clamp to safe bounds automatically

**"Too many shapes"**
- Canvas limit: 1000 shapes total
- Consider deleting unused shapes

**"Invalid tile type"**
- Use only: grass, dirt, water, stone, flower
- Check spelling and case

## Troubleshooting

### AI Doesn't Understand Command
1. **Rephrase in simpler terms**: "Create circle" instead of "Make a round thing"
2. **Break into steps**: "Generate terrain" then "Add decorations" instead of "Create complete level"
3. **Use examples as templates**: Copy format from examples above
4. **Let AI ask questions**: Say "Create a level" and AI will clarify details

### Smart Suggestions Not Appearing
‚ö†Ô∏è **Status:** Requires Foundation Fix Phase 1
- Smart suggestions are built but not connected
- Expected fix: 1-2 days
- Workaround: Use example commands directly

### Performance Commands Not Working
‚ö†Ô∏è **Status:** Requires Foundation Fix Phase 1
- Performance profiler exists but not recording data
- Expected fix: 1-2 days
- Workaround: Manually check FPS in DevTools

### "Rate Limit Exceeded" Error
- **Limit:** 10 requests per minute
- **Solution:** Wait 60 seconds
- **Prevention:** Combine operations into single commands
- **Note:** Complex procedural generation counts as 1 request

### Generation Takes Too Long
For large tilemaps (>100x100):
1. Use `preview` mode first: "Generate preview of 200x200 terrain"
2. Consider smaller sizes: 50x50 for testing
3. Check console for progress
4. Large generations may take 5-10 seconds

### "Canvas Bounds Exceeded" Error
- **Limit:** Coordinates must be 0-5000 pixels
- **Solution:** AI will auto-clamp to bounds
- **Tilemap:** Max 500x500 tiles

### Procedural Generation Looks Wrong
**Perlin Noise too chaotic:**
- Increase scale (0.15 ‚Üí 0.08)
- Reduce octaves (6 ‚Üí 4)

**Caves too dense:**
- Reduce initial density (0.5 ‚Üí 0.4)
- Increase iterations (3 ‚Üí 8)

**Paths too straight:**
- Increase turn probability (0.05 ‚Üí 0.15)

**Request regeneration:**
- "Regenerate with different parameters"
- "Make it more varied/smooth/organic"

---

## Performance Tips

### For Large Canvases (500+ shapes)
- Use tilemap for terrain (not individual shapes)
- Request "Analyze performance" periodically
- Enable viewport culling: "Optimize canvas"

### For Large Tilemaps (10,000+ tiles)
- Generate in layers: terrain first, decoration later
- Use chunking: "Generate rows 0-50 first"
- Consider smaller tile size
- Test performance before adding more

### For Procedural Generation
- Start small (30x30) to test parameters
- Use `seed` for reproducible results
- Save good parameters for reuse
- Use preview mode for large maps

---

## Advanced Usage

### Using Seeds for Reproducibility
```
"Generate 50x50 terrain with seed 12345"
*Later...*
"Generate 50x50 terrain with seed 12345"
*Produces identical terrain*
```

### Combining Algorithms
```
1. "Generate 80x80 Perlin noise terrain"
2. "Add cave systems using cellular automata in rows 20-60"
3. "Create a river path through the middle"
4. "Add decoration layer with trees"
```

### Layer-Based Generation (‚ö†Ô∏è Foundation Fix Required)
```
1. "Create terrain layer: 100x100 Perlin noise"
2. "Create decoration layer: trees and rocks"
3. "Create object layer: enemies and items"
4. "Show only terrain layer"
```

### Constraint-Based Generation
```
"Generate platformer terrain where:
 - Platforms are jumpable distance apart
 - No isolated unreachable areas
 - Water only at bottom
 - At least 3 platform layers"
```
