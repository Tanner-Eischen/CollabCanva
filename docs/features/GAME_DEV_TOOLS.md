  },
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": "shape-123",
      "type": "rectangle",
      "transform": {
        "x": 100,

## üìö Tips & Tricks

### Performance

- **Optimize Sprite Sheets**: Use power-of-2 dimensions when possible (256x256, 512x512)
- **Limit Animation FPS**: 12 FPS is often sufficient for pixel art
- **Use Tilesets**: More efficient than individual tile images
- **Atlas Packing**: Group similar assets into atlases

### Organization

- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive, consistent names
  - Good: `player_walk_right`, `tile_grass_01`
  - Bad: `sprite1`, `image_final_2`
  
- **Folder Structure**:
  ```
  Assets/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Characters/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Enemies/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Environment/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tiles/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backgrounds/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UI/
  ```

- **Tagging Strategy**:
  - Use categories: `character`, `environment`, `ui`, `effect`
  - Use descriptors: `animated`, `static`, `transparent`
  - Use states: `idle`, `walk`, `jump`, `attack`

### Collaboration

- **Real-Time Editing**: Multiple users can edit simultaneously
- **Presence Indicators**: See who's working on what
- **Asset Sharing**: Shared project assets available to all collaborators
- **Export Versioning**: Include version numbers in export filenames

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Animations Not Playing
- Check FPS is set (>0)
- Verify frames are defined correctly
- Ensure animation is marked as "playing" in properties

### Physics Not Working
- Confirm "Enable Physics" is toggled on
- Check body type is appropriate (Dynamic for moving objects)
- Verify collision shape is defined and visible

### Export Issues
- Ensure all assets are uploaded (check Asset Library)
- Verify no missing references (red warnings in export modal)
- Check file name validity (no special characters)

### Tilemap Problems
- Confirm tileset is sliced correctly
- Check auto-tiling rules for tileset type
- Verify tile dimensions match tileset grid
