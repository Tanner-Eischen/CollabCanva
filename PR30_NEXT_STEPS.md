## üéØ Before You Can Test

### Required: Set Your OpenAI API Key

**Option A: Quick Setup (Recommended for testing)**

1. Get API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create `functions/.env`:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   ```
   Create `.env` file with:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview
   OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
   OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.2
   ```

3. Build and start emulator:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   cd ..
   firebase emulators:start --only functions
   ```

4. In another terminal, enable AI features:
   - Create `.env` in project root (if it doesn't exist)
   - Add: `VITE_AI_ENABLED=true`
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`

5. Open app and click ü§ñ button!

**Option B: Production Setup**

For deploying to production Firebase:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="sk-your-key"
firebase functions:config:set openai.model="gpt-4-turbo-preview"
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Basic Tests
- [ ] AI chat panel opens when clicking ü§ñ button
- [ ] Example commands are displayed
- [ ] "Create a red circle at (200, 200)" works
- [ ] Shape appears on canvas after command
- [ ] Success message shows in chat

### Shape Tools
- [ ] Create different shape types (circle, rectangle, star)
- [ ] Delete selected shapes
- [ ] Modify shape properties (color, size)
- [ ] Move shapes to new positions
- [ ] Resize and rotate shapes

### Layout Tools
- [ ] Arrange shapes in grid/row/column
- [ ] Distribute shapes with equal spacing
- [ ] Align shapes to edges/center

### Tilemap Tools
- [ ] Switch to tilemap mode
- [ ] Paint tile regions
- [ ] Erase tile regions
- [ ] Generate noise terrain (50x50)
- [ ] Generate caves (40x40)
- [ ] Generate paths (30x30)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid command shows error message
- [ ] Rate limit warning after 10 requests
- [ ] Graceful handling of API errors

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### 1. CORS Issues
If running locally, Firebase emulator should handle CORS automatically. If you see CORS errors:
- Ensure emulator is running: `firebase emulators:start --only functions`
- Check that client is calling `localhost:5001` (not production)

### 2. TypeScript Compilation
If you see TypeScript errors in functions:
```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Module Import Issues
The functions use dynamic imports for tools. Ensure all tool files are compiled:
```bash
cd functions
rm -rf lib
npm run build
```

### 4. Rate Limiting Too Aggressive
If testing, you can temporarily adjust rate limits in `functions/src/ai-proxy.ts`:
```typescript
const RATE_LIMIT_MAX = 50; // Instead of 10
```

---

## üöÄ Day 2 Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Manual Testing**
   - Test all 14 AI tools
   - Document any bugs found
   - Test in both shape and tilemap modes

2. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fix any issues discovered during testing
   - Improve error messages
   - Handle edge cases

3. **UI Polish**
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add command suggestions based on context

### Medium Priority
4. **Command History**
   - Save conversation to localStorage
   - Restore on page reload
   - Clear history button

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Ctrl/Cmd+K to open AI assistant
   - Escape to close
   - Arrow up to recall last command

6. **Context Improvements**
   - Include canvas name in context
   - Better viewport information
   - Recent actions history

### Nice to Have
7. **Voice Input**
   - Speech-to-text for commands
   - "Wake word" activation

8. **AI Suggestions**
   - Suggest commands based on canvas state
   - "Did you mean...?" for typos
   - Auto-complete for common commands

---

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### What to Track
- Average response time
- OpenAI API costs per day
- Most used commands
- Error rates
- User satisfaction

### Metrics to Add
```typescript
// In ai-proxy.ts, after successful execution:
functions.logger.info('AI metrics', {
  userId,
  commandType: toolName,
  duration: executionTime,
  tokensUsed: response.usage?.total_tokens,
  success: true
});
```

### Cost Tracking
Monitor your OpenAI dashboard:
- Daily API usage
- Cost per request
- Rate of errors

Estimated costs (with rate limiting):
- 10 users: ~$5-10/month
- 50 users: ~$25-50/month
- 100 users: ~$50-100/month

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Before Production
1. **API Key Security**
   - Never commit `.env` to git ‚úÖ (already in .gitignore)
   - Rotate keys every 90 days
   - Use separate keys for dev/prod

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Current: 10 requests/min/user
   - Consider per-canvas limits
   - Add daily user quotas

3. **Input Validation**
   - All inputs validated ‚úÖ
   - SQL injection: N/A (using Firebase)
   - XSS prevention: ‚úÖ (sanitization in place)

4. **Access Control**
   - Currently: Any authenticated user
   - Consider: Canvas-level permissions
   - Future: Role-based access (admin, editor, viewer)
